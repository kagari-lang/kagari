# Kagari Implementation Roadmap

[Foundation refactor](foundation-refactor.md) is the sole active R01–R18 execution plan. Its three semantic contracts and checkpoint status define the behavior to implement and verify. Each completed checkpoint requires a Conventional Commit with a `Roadmap-Step: Rxx` trailer. The [performance baseline](performance-baseline.md) records R18 measurements.

The former M1–M11 milestone queue is historical and has been removed from this document. Git history retains its original scope and commits; those milestones do not prescribe current APIs, compatibility branches, artifact formats, or acceptance criteria.

After the foundation track, plan separate work for complete LSP/editor integration, a full incremental dependency database, async and cross-thread execution policy, incremental or generational GC, complete event replay and persistent state migration, advanced JIT optimization, and further standard-library coverage. These tracks reuse the foundation contracts without reopening their semantics.

Completed language extension: ordinary associated types, equality bindings,
projection bounds and qualified projections, preserving the existing static and
dynamic interface model. The [trait contract](spec/traits.md#ordinary-associated-types),
[runnable example](../examples/syntax/associated-types.kgr) and associated-type
integration tests define this checkpoint. Subsequent trait extensions are
recorded below; advanced coherence/solver features remain future work.

Completed language extension: generic implementation interface tables, keyed by
impl declaration and concrete arguments, with shared instantiation limits and
cross-module method reachability. See the [trait contract](spec/traits.md#generic-implementation-interface-instances)
and [runnable example](../examples/syntax/generic-interfaces.kgr). Artifact format
44 and runtime ABI v44 reject prior formats without migration.

Completed language extension: host associated-output declarations and dynamic
interfaces, using offline contracts and verified IR forwarding functions through
the existing host boundary. See the [trait contract](spec/traits.md#host-associated-outputs-and-interfaces)
and [embedding example](../crates/kagari-embed/examples/host_interfaces.rs).
Integration tests cover source/artifact execution, JIT-enabled execution,
cross-module generic inputs, GC, reentry, traps and retained reload versions.
Artifact format 45, runtime ABI v45 and KHI v10 reject previous products.

Completed language extension: bounded, acyclic trait inheritance, transitive
static bounds, inherited associated projections and dynamic interface upcasting.
Diamond paths deduplicate the same applied declaration; unrelated same-named
methods are ambiguous. Source, artifact and JIT fallback tests cover cross-module
generic parents, invalid graphs, GC and retained reload versions. See the
[trait contract](spec/traits.md#trait-inheritance-and-upcasting) and
[runnable example](../examples/syntax/trait-inheritance.kgr). Artifact format 46
and runtime ABI v46 reject previous products; KHI remains v10.

Completed language extension: checked default method bodies, explicit override
precedence and fallback for script impls, including generic impls, method-local
generics, associated outputs, closures and imported private helpers. Defaults
are specialized in the impl's module while retaining the trait's checked name
resolution and original debug source. See the [trait contract](spec/traits.md#default-methods)
and [runnable example](../examples/syntax/default-methods.kgr). Artifact format 47
and runtime ABI v47 reject previous products; KHI remains v10. Host mappings
continue to explicitly provide every declared method.

Completed language extension: scalar associated constants, required definitions,
defaults and overrides, inherited access and qualified static paths. Source and
artifact validation reject constant-bearing dynamic interfaces, including
subtraits. Artifact format 48 and runtime ABI v48 reject previous products;
KHI remains v10. Native host tables cannot supply constants; use script impls.

Completed language extension: type-parameterized generic associated types,
declaration-owned constructor binders, input and output bounds, inherited
projections, generic impls and defaults. Source, encoded artifacts and JIT-enabled
execution cover static specialization, imported contracts and malformed unused
metadata. See the [trait contract](spec/traits.md#generic-associated-types) and
[runnable example](../examples/syntax/generic-associated-types.kgr). Artifact
format 49 and runtime ABI v49 reject previous products; KHI remains v10.

Traits declaring associated constants or GAT, including every descendant,
are static-only. Native host tables cannot supply those members; script impls
on host types can. Lifetimes, script-level `dyn`, higher-kinded type parameters,
associated type defaults, specialization, negative impls, auto traits and
advanced coherence/solver behavior are outside this sequence.

Completed language extension: built-in Option/Result constructors, namespace and
alias imports, nested and alternative patterns, postfix `?`, explicit Option to
Result conversion, and checked script callbacks for map/map_err/and_then.
Source, encoded artifacts and JIT fallback share ordinary frame control flow,
including GC and iteration cleanup. See [builtins](spec/builtins.md#option-and-result)
and [result-option.kgr](../examples/syntax/result-option.kgr). Artifact format 50
and runtime ABI v50 reject previous products; KHI remains v10. General built-in
propagation traits and Error origin/stack modeling are a later design checkpoint.

Completed standard-protocol checkpoint: declaration-owned PartialEq/Eq/Hash and
Debug/Display, ordinary generic and associated bounds, sealed intrinsic equality
and hashing, explicit nominal formatting impls, structural and identity keys,
and GC tracing of keys. See [contracts](spec/builtins.md) and
[standard-traits.kgr](../examples/syntax/standard-traits.kgr). Artifact format 51,
runtime ABI v51 and KHI v11 reject old products. Protocol interface boxing,
Iterator, generalized propagation and Error origin/stack modeling remain
separate later checkpoints.

Completed equality checkpoint: object identity operators `===`/`!==`, checked
from syntax through IR and VM, with artifact format 52 and runtime ABI v52.
Source/artifact/JIT-fallback tests cover aliases and separate allocations; runtime
tests reject foreign, stale and mistagged handles.

Completed custom equality and hashing checkpoint: explicit Struct and enum
PartialEq/Eq/Hash implementations, generic bounds, recursive composite helpers,
and guarded Map/Set callbacks. Native defaults retain their fast path. Type-owned
implementations keep dependency and caller semantics consistent. Tests cover
cross-variant enum equality, nested keys, collisions, GC, callback traps, reentry,
budget cleanup, portable metadata and source/artifact/JIT fallback execution.
See the [contract](spec/value-semantics.md#equality-and-hashing) and
[example](../examples/syntax/standard-traits.kgr). Artifact format 53 and runtime
ABI v53 reject previous products; KHI remains v11. Key stability and equivalence
laws are user obligations; there is no automatic freezing or reindexing.


## Standard operator protocols

The B01–B06 extension sequence is complete. Each checkpoint updates contracts,
examples and relevant tests and is committed separately using Conventional Commits.
Clone, writable indexing and compound-assignment overrides are separate designs.

- [x] B01: declaration-owned standard protocol inputs, associated outputs and parent metadata shared with portable contracts.
- [x] B02: Ordering, PartialOrd and Ord, including checked comparison dispatch.
- [x] B03: Add/Sub/Mul/Div/Rem with an explicit RHS type and associated Output.
- [x] B04: Neg/Not with associated Output.
- [x] B05: read-only Index; returned objects retain shared reference semantics.
- [x] B06: source/artifact/backend conformance, examples, documentation and workspace checks.

Builtin operations retain direct instructions. Custom implementations use ordinary
static linked calls. Operands evaluate once from left to right. These protocols
remain static-only in this sequence. Short-circuit and identity operators cannot
be overridden. Existing assignment and mutation guarantees are unchanged.

The sequence uses artifact format 57 and runtime ABI v57; earlier products are
rejected without migration. KHI remains v11. The operator conformance suite checks
source, encoded artifacts and JIT-enabled fallback with collection at allocation
safepoints, cross-module generic implementations, single evaluation and target
identity, malformed contracts, unordered floats and preserved builtin fast paths.

B06 validation: 1,116 workspace tests passed (including 17 operator integration
cases); `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --
-D warnings` and `git diff --check` passed. Integration cases also cover applied
RHS overload selection and resource cleanup after operator traps/budget exhaustion.

## Conversion and iteration protocols

- [x] B07: explicit From/Into and TryFrom/TryInto, static conversion calls, derived reverse bounds and associated errors.
- [x] B08: Iterator/IntoIterator contracts, custom for loops and native collection integration.
- [ ] B09: conformance, examples, resource cleanup and workspace validation.

Each checkpoint uses a Conventional Commit. Conversions are explicit; reverse
protocols are derived and cannot be implemented independently. Iteration preserves
native structural-mutation guards; custom iterators own their consistency rules.
Error origins, general propagation, Clone and writable indexing remain separate.

B08 uses artifact format 59 and runtime ABI v59. Custom iterators and native
cursors share protocol-based for lowering. Native cursors retain source guards,
GC roots and code versions; loop/session cleanup and structural revision checks
cover early exit and resumed cursors. See the authoritative iteration contract in
[the builtins specification](spec/builtins.md#iteration-protocols).
